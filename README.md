# MMOLED_Clock
## A simple little weekend clock gone sideways

This is clock using:
- Adafruit Metro Mini 328
- 2 x SSD1306 OLED 128x64 screens
- Rasp PI DS3231 Real Time Clock (RTC) 

The hours are displayed on display1 and minutes on display2. All of the 
devices communicate via I2C. A resistor needs to be removed from one of
the SSD1306 to change the I2C hardware address. 

## coming up. . . 
A thrid screen.
